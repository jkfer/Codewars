https://www.codewars.com/kata/next-smaller-number-with-the-same-digits/python

Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns 
the next smaller positive integer containing the same digits.

For example:

next_smaller(21) == 12
next_smaller(531) == 513
next_smaller(2071) == 2017

next_smaller(9) == -1
next_smaller(135) == -1
next_smaller(1027) == -1  # 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros
some tests will include very large numbers.
test data only employs positive integers.
